📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning & Deep Learning
This project tackles the critical issue of misinformation by building and evaluating a suite of machine learning and deep learning models to classify news articles as Real or Fake. By analyzing the textual content (title and body), the models learn to identify linguistic patterns that distinguish credible news from fabricated stories.

🚀 Overview
The core of this project is a comparative analysis of different classification algorithms. We start with comprehensive text preprocessing, followed by feature extraction using TF-IDF. Finally, multiple models—from classic algorithms like Naive Bayes to a deep learning-based Feed-Forward Neural Network—are trained and evaluated on their ability to accurately detect fake news.

✨ Key Features
🧹 Text Preprocessing: Rigorous cleaning of text data including tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stopwords to create a clean corpus.

📊 Feature Extraction: Utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert the combined title and text into meaningful numerical vectors.

📈 Performance Evaluation: In-depth model assessment using Accuracy, Classification Reports, Confusion Matrices, and Training Time Analysis.
